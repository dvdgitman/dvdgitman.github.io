I'm a DevOps Engineer from Israel with a strong focus on cloud automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). My core expertise lies in building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines and deploying containerized applications on the cloud.

☁️ Cloud Platforms: Primarily AWS, with experience in GCP and other cloud environments.
🛠️ Core Technologies: Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Github Actions, and Bash scripting.
💡 Strengths: I excel at troubleshooting complex system-level issues, thrive in high-pressure environments, and am driven to build efficient, self-healing infrastructure.
🎬 Personal Lab: In my spare time, I run a fully automated home media server using Plex, Sonarr, and Radarr, all containerized with Docker. It's my personal playground for experimenting with automation and system management.
