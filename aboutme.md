subtitle: Blending backend development with DevOps expertise to build resilient and efficient systems.
---

As an engineer with deep roots in DevOps and a current focus on Backend Development at Wix, I bring a holistic perspective to building software. My passion is creating systems that are not only powerful and scalable but also automated, maintainable, and reliable from the ground up.

I believe that the best solutions come from a deep understanding of the entire development lifecycle, from code to cloud.

### Core Competencies

My technical skills are centered around modern cloud-native and automation technologies.

* **Cloud Platforms:** Extensive experience with **AWS** and practical knowledge of **GCP**, designing and managing cloud infrastructure.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Using **Terraform** and **Ansible** to automate the provisioning and configuration of environments.
* **CI/CD & Automation:** Building and maintaining robust pipelines with **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, and scripting in **Bash**.
* **Containerization:** Leveraging **Docker** and **Kubernetes (EKS)** to package, deploy, and orchestrate applications at scale.

### My Approach

I thrive on solving complex system-level issues, especially under pressure. My goal is always to build self-healing infrastructure that empowers development teams to move faster and more confidently.

### Beyond the 9-to-5: My Home Lab

My passion for technology continues at home where I run a fully automated media server using **Plex**, **Sonarr**, and **Radarr**â€”all containerized with **Docker**. This personal lab is my playground for experimenting with new automation techniques, networking, and system management in a real-world environment.
