As a **Backend Developer at Wix**, I leverage a robust DevOps background to build and maintain scalable, production-ready systems. My current role involves tackling complex backend challenges where I blend my skills in software development with a deep understanding of the underlying infrastructure, ensuring that our services are not only well-coded but also resilient and operationally efficient.

My core expertise was forged as a **Lead DevOps Engineer**, where I specialized in Infrastructure as Code (**Terraform**, **Ansible**), CI/CD pipelines (**Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**), and container orchestration (**Docker**, **Kubernetes**). I have a proven track record of managing cloud infrastructure on **AWS** and implementing comprehensive monitoring solutions with tools like **Kibana** and **Elasticsearch** to maintain system health and high availability.

My technical journey began with foundational roles as an **Integration Engineer** and **IT Specialist**, giving me hands-on experience with hardware, networking, and systems administration. This end-to-end perspective allows me to solve problems holistically, from the physical layer all the way up to the application.
